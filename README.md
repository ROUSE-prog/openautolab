# OpenAutoLab
Film developing machine
OpenAutoLab is an attempt at making a cheap and simple film developing machine. Inspired by Jobo Autolab, but cheaper, more repairable and open source. Agitation is done by periodically moving fully submerged film, not rotating the drum constantly, so it is also more flexible, as it supports black-and-white processes.   
[`parts`](parts/README.md) subdirectory contains information about all used electronic and mechanical components.  
[`build_instructions`](build_instructions/README.md) explains how to build the machine from scratch.  
[`main_board`](main_board/README.md) concentrates on main board schematics and PCB layouts.  
[`arduino_code`](arduino_code/README.md) subdirectory contains source code for the controller of the machine.
