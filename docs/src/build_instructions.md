This site contains detailed instructions for building OpenAutoLab.

 - Start out by aquiring all [parts](parts.md) of the machine.
 - If you already have all parts, refer to [building](building.md).
 - If you want to 3d-print some or all of the parts yourself, refer to [making parts](making_parts.md).
 - If some parts like magnets, valves, hoses, pumps, vessels differ from the ones on the parts list in such a way, that you need changes in models for 3d-printing, refer to [modifying parts](modifying_parts.md).
 - If you want to modify the main board, for example make it one-sided for home production, or increase the number of valves for using more than 4 chemicals in one process, refer to the [`main_board` chapter](main_board.md).
