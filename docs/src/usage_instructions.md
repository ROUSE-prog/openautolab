# General Information

This document is a user manual for an already built OpenAutoLab.
If you want to build the machine, refer to the [Build Instructions](build_instructions.md) chapter.

OpenAutoLab is a machine designed to simplify the film developing process.
It pumps necessary chemicals into developing tank, agitates the film properly for the correct amount of time, pumps the chemicals back, washes the film and does all of that without interrupting the user.
The user has to load the film into the tank, pour the chemicals into their vessels, connect to the source of clean water and drain for waste water, start the program, wait for the end of the program and dry the developed film.
The machine can be used in tempertaure-controlled water bath to achieve good results in color processing or without one if temperature precision is not critical.

Developing tank is a special light-tight container, that allows the liquids to be pumped into and from it, while keeping the film in complete darkness. The film should be loaded into the tank also in darkness and is not allowed to be exposed to the light until the end of the development. The main pump moves liquid from the vessel into the tank through the open valve, which is defined by the development process, and then pumps it back after defined amount of time. The amount of the pumped liquid is controlled by the force gauge. The correct speed of the chemical reaction is
