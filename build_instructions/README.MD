This folder contains detailed instructions for building OpenAutoLab.  
If you already have all parts, refer to building.MD  
If you want to 3d-print some or all of the parts yourself, refer to making_parts.MD  
If some parts like magnets, valves, hoses, pumps, vessels differ from the ones on the parts list in such a way, that you need changes in models for 3d-printing, refer to modifying_parts.MD  
If you want to modify the main board, for example make it one-sided for home production, or increase the number of valves for using more than 4 chemicals in one process, refer to main_board subdirectory.
